<h2 style="text-align: center">Hospital system with Clinical results</h2>

<p>A fully working Hospital system build on ASP.Net MVC 5 using C# with main purpose - to add clinical results (pdf) for patients, online. Patient must register an account to allow the admin (some doctor) to upload a file on already registered ones. Admin can search for users, doctors and clinical results in the administration layout - upload new ones and delete them. Also can download pdf that are uploaded for patients. If the result is pending or just some results are ready (ready/inProgres), there are options that inform the patient when he log to the system. There are also information about current doctors, clinical trials and specialties that clinical trials belong to in the official site. This information can be updated in administration layout by admin.<br> Registration form is in Login popup.</p>
